## Experience

### Gulo Composites, Brevard, NC (2018 - Present)
At Gulo Composites, I've been immersed in the intersection of technology and mechanical engineering. Collaborating with the lead Mechanical Engineer, I played a pivotal role in predicting tensile strength and break points for the G1 Carbon Spoke. This involved applying my data science skills, utilizing predictive models like linear regression and gradient descent. The insights gained from these models were seamlessly integrated into Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software, where I visualized and analyzed results using SolidWorks Simulation.

Beyond data science, I've contributed to the physical realm by personally overseeing the production of over 1,000 wheels, catering to both retail and special order customers. In addition, I took on the responsibility of crafting a comprehensive training guide for future mechanics, ensuring a seamless onboarding process.

My role extended beyond the technical aspects, as I actively maintained customer relationships through a robust CRM system and provided excellent customer service. Managing social media accounts, I ensured a visually appealing and cohesive brand theme, showcasing both the technical precision and aesthetic excellence of our products.

### Coda del Pesce, Charleston, SC (2012 - 2018)
My experience at Coda del Pesce immersed me in the world of fine dining and hospitality. Serving as Lead Server and Sommelier, I not only curated and managed the wine menu but also trained servers on new and existing wines, leading to a notable increase in revenue.

My responsibilities extended to both onsite and offsite events, where I personally curated wine selections tailored to each unique event. Alongside this, I took charge of managing and maintaining financial records, demonstrating proficiency in financial oversight and attention to detail. Simultaneously, I maintained the restaurant's online presence by regularly updating the website with the latest news, specials, and events.

### IMOCO, Fletcher, NC (2001-2011)
Earlier in my career, I honed my skills as a CNC Machinist and Programmer at IMOCO. Operating CNC machines, I delved into G-code programming and CNC software, creating custom HVAC piping and components for large-scale units from leading brands like Trane, Lennox, and Rheem. This role demanded exceptional precision and attention to detail to meet tight tolerances and specifications.

This diverse journey across CNC programming, fine dining, and mechanical engineering projects has equipped me with not only a robust understanding of computer science and programming but also exceptional customer service, interpersonal, and sales skills.
